# Archaeological Data Management and Query Design with SQL

This project focuses on using **SQL** and **Microsoft Access** for effective **data management** and **data cleaning** in the context of archaeological site analysis. The project involves setting up a database, managing historical data of archaeological sites, and designing complex SQL queries to analyze and visualize the information. The goal was to organize the data efficiently, perform various queries to extract meaningful insights, and demonstrate an understanding of relational database management.

## Features

- **Database Design**: Designed and implemented a database with multiple tables for archaeological sites and literature references, enabling streamlined data management.
- **Data Cleaning**: Imported and structured data, ensuring consistency across tables and fields.
- **Complex Queries**: Developed SQL queries to extract information such as site counts by place, settlement periods, and literature references by publication year.
- **Relational Data**: Managed relationships between tables, including sites, periods, and literature references, to provide comprehensive data insights.

## Why This Project Matters

This project showcases the ability to apply **SQL** and **Microsoft Access** to manage and analyze complex datasets. The skills demonstrated here are directly transferable to roles involving **data management**, **data cleaning**, and **query design** across various industries, including archaeological research, data science, and business analytics. 

## Methodology

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Created a relational database with tables for **archaeological sites**, **periods**, and **literature references**.
   - Cleaned and normalized data to ensure consistency across entries, particularly in the `Start_period` and `End_period` fields.
   
2. **SQL Queries**:
   - Designed and implemented queries to extract key insights from the database, such as the number of settlements by site type and place, and literature references by publication year.
   - Examples of queries include filtering sites based on the Roman Period and joining tables to show relevant site data.

3. **Data Relationships**:
   - Established relationships between the tables to track the literature references for each site.
   - Used **JOINs** to link tables and extract meaningful data for analysis.

## Key Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Query design and relational data manipulation.
- **Microsoft Access**: Database design, management, and implementation.
- **Data Management**: Data cleaning, normalization, and relationship management.
- **Data Analysis**: SQL queries for aggregation, filtering, and reporting.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a thorough understanding of **data management** and **SQL query design** within a structured database, with direct applications to the field of Archaeology. It highlights key skills in database setup, data cleaning, and relational data manipulation, which are essential for organizing and analyzing archaeological site data. The use of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from archaeological datasets can enhance research efficiency, aid in identifying patterns across historical periods, and support decision-making in archaeological studies.
